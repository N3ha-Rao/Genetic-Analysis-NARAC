# Genetic Analysis of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Using North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium (NARAC) Data

This study was carried out as a final project for the course [SPH BS 859](https://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-bs-859/). 

## Dataset

The NARAC data comes from a case-control study of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA; N=868 cases, N=1194 controls). Cases were recruited from across the United States and are predominantly of Northern European origin. All met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA. The controls are derived from the New York Cancer Project, were enrolled in the New York metropolitan area and are somewhat enriched for individuals of Southern European or Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry compared with cases. All subjects are believed to be unrelated.
